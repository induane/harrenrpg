  # already have the quest and haven't triggered some other thing by having an
  # item or something, the alt_dialog is what the player will see until they
  # complete the quest or get some other items.

  # Make sure to set start_quest to true for the event that is meant to kick
  # off the quest in general. If it's not set, then the system will ignore it
  # and the quest won't start. This is so that you don't talk to some other
  # NPC that's involved in the quest and have it accidentally "start" the quest
  # for you.
